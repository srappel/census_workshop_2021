# Setup

Please complete this setup before the workshop.

### Basic Setup

The workshop will be held in Zoom. A camera and microphone are not required, but are encouraged for participation and discussion. Please prepare to mute your microphone and unmute only when you would like to speak.

It's strongly recommended to use two monitors or two devices, one to follow along and one to view the zoom webinar.

### Register for an account at NHGIS

First, create an account on NHGIS.org at [this registration link](https://uma.pop.umn.edu/nhgis/user/new).*

### Getting ArcGIS Pro**

UWM Students should [follow this link to the Student Software page](https://uwm.edu/software/student-software/) and find the installation instructions for ArcGIS Pro.

UWM Faculty or Staff should [follow this link to the Faculty/Staff Software page](https://uwm.edu/software/faculty-staff-software/) and find the installation instructions for ArcGIS Pro.***

Attendees without UWM credentials should consider a [free trial](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-pro/trial) or using alternative software such as the free and open source [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org).

### Notes

\* If you would prefer not to create an NHGIS account, but still want to follow along you will need [download the sample data]() during the workshop.

\*\* If you would prefer to use QGIS, ArcGIS Desktop, or any other GIS for this workshop you are more than welcome to. The tutorial is written for ArcGIS pro, but the tools used are somewhat ubiquitous. If you can perform functions like adding data, joins, and symbology, you should have no problems following along with some adjustment.

\*\*\* Faculty and Staff can access ArcGIS Pro only on university-owned workstations under our site license with ESRI.
