# Setup

Please complete this setup before the workshop.

### Register for an account at NHGIS

First, create an account on NHGIS.org at [this registration link](https://uma.pop.umn.edu/nhgis/user/new). If you would prefer not to create an account and agree to the terms of service, sample data can be downloaded during the workshop that will allow you to participate.
However, an account is required to download any data from the system and is highly recommended. Neither NHGIS nor IPUMS are affiliated with this workshop today.

### Getting ArcGIS Pro (or ArcGIS Desktop)

UWM Students should [follow this link to the Student Software page](https://uwm.edu/software/student-software/) and find the installation instructions for ArcGIS Pro.

UWM Faculty or Staff should [follow this link to the Faculty/Staff Software page](https://uwm.edu/software/faculty-staff-software/) and find the installation instructions for ArcGIS Pro. 
*Note: University-owned PCs only*

Attendees without UWM credentials or faculty/staff on a personal computer should consider a [free trial](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-pro/trial) or using alternative software such as the free and open source [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org).
