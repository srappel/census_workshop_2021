# Setup

Please complete this setup before the workshop.

First, create an account on NHGIS.org at [this registration link](https://uma.pop.umn.edu/nhgis/user/new). If you would prefer not to create an account and agree to the terms of service, sample data can be downloaded during the workshop that will allow you to participate. However, an account is required to download any data from the system and is highly recommended. Neither NHGIS nor IPUMS are affiliated with this workshop today.

If you don't already have ArcGIS Pro on your computer, you will follow the instructions below.
### Getting ArcGIS Pro (or ArcGIS Desktop)

UWM Students should follow the installation instructions for ArcGIS Pro here: https://uwm.edu/software/student-software/

UWM Staff and Faculty should work with the software office to access ArcGIS Pro.

Attendees without UWM credentials should consider a [free trial](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-pro/trial) or using alternative software such as the free and open source [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org).
