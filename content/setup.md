# Getting ArcGIS Pro (or ArcGIS Desktop)

UWM Students should follow the installation instructions for ArcGIS Pro here: https://uwm.edu/software/student-software/

UWM Staff and Faculty should work with the software office to access ArcGIS Pro.

Attendees without UWM credentials should consider a free trial or using alternative software such as the free and open source [QGIS](www.qgis.org).
