# Land acknowledgement

Before beginning the workshop, we'd like to acknowledge the indigenous lands where we are located.    

We acknowledge in Milwaukee that we are on traditional Potawatomi, Ho-Chunk and Menominee homeland along the southwest shores of Michigami, North America’s largest system of freshwater lakes, where the Milwaukee, Menominee and Kinnickinnic rivers meet and the people of Wisconsin’s sovereign Anishinaabe, Ho-Chunk, Menominee, Oneida and Mohican nations remain present.

If you are not in Milwaukee, take a moment to explore [native-land.ca](https://native-land.ca/) so that you can visualize the indigenous territories, languages, and treaties in your area.

We feel it is especially important for those of us who work with spatial and geographic information to understand the diverse histories of the lands we find ourselves. We ask that as you participate in GIS Day, take a moment now and then to think about indigenous histories, territories, and knowledge systems in the context of of GIS, map-making, governance, and other topics that come up in sessions and discussions.
