# Land acknowledgement

Before beginning the workshop, we'd like to acknowledge the indigenous lands where we are located.    

We acknowledge in Milwaukee that we are on traditional Potawatomi, Ho-Chunk and Menominee homeland along the southwest shores of Michigami, North America’s largest system of freshwater lakes, where the Milwaukee, Menominee and Kinnickinnic rivers meet and the people of Wisconsin’s sovereign Anishinaabe, Ho-Chunk, Menominee, Oneida and Mohican nations remain present.

If you are not in Milwaukee, take a moment to explore [native-land.ca](https://native-land.ca/) so that you can visualize the indigenous territories, languages, and treaties in your area.

It's important to address how this relates to our subject matter today. Below is some information from NCAI:

> The Census is a critical and powerful information source that will significantly influence American policy for the coming decade. 
> It is the foundation of American democracy in that it determines the allocation of Congressional seats. 
> It is also used extensively to distribute funds to tribal, state, and local governments, and 
> it serves as a foundation for policymaking as well as research and program evaluation in think tanks, universities, and 
> at all levels of government.

American Indians are an historically undercounted group in the Census:

> Native people especially on reservations and in Alaska Native villages have been historically underrepresented in the census, and 
> in 2020, new methodologies for enumerating the US population could put other groups at risk.
> In the 2010 Census, the Census Bureau estimates that American Indians and Alaska Natives living on reservations or in Native villages were undercounted by approximately 4.9 percent, 
> more than double the undercount rate of the next closest population group.

We feel it is especially important for those of us who work with spatial and geographic information to understand the diverse histories of the lands we find ourselves. We ask that as you participate in GIS Day, take a moment now and then to think about indigenous histories, territories, and knowledge systems in the context of of GIS, map-making, governance, and other topics that come up in sessions and discussions.
