# Website for Census workshop at UWM Spring 2021 GIS Day

It is based off a template created during a workshop during WAML 2020.

[This GitHub repository](https://github.com/ubc-lib-geo/gis-workshop-waml-template) holds a template for a Jekyll site hosted on GitHub pages. You can find the public facing side of the template [here](https://ubc-lib-geo.github.io/gis-workshop-waml-template/).

Want to use this template? Great! Just fork it and follow these [instructions for activating it via Pages](https://ubc-lib-geo.github.io/gis-workshop-waml-template/content/handson/fork-repo.html).

The template was created by [Evan Thornberry](https://github.com/ect123) (UBC) and [Phil White](https://github.com/outpw) (CU Boulder) as part of the Western Association of Map Libraries (WAML) 2020 preconference workshop on teaching with GitHub.
